#TODO
- Add asynchronous signal emitting.
- Unsubscribe is currently an O(n*m) operation. It can be made O(n) if each
	delegate stores its state. The pros and cons need to be considered here
	(i.e. does this break normaization). 
- Add method for dynamically declaring signals (register)
- Add a reciprocal function for register (unregister)
- Add an unsubscribeAll function
- Add unregisterAll
- Add _checkStream function
- Add state to signals. This will require changing them from strings into 
	objects. Each key in the signals object will be the identifier. Each
	signal will have the option to be sync or async. There may be more options
	in the future.
- Add working examples of observable code.
- Add performance profile to determine overhead of observable-js
